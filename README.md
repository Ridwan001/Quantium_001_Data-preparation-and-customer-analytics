# Quantium_001_Data-preparation-and-customer-analytics
Conduct analysis on client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

TASK.
We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the upcoming category review however to do so we need to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customersâ€™ purchasing behaviour.  

To get started, begin by performing high level data checks such as:


    Creating and interpreting high level summaries of the data
    Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable)
    Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable)

You will also want to derive extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data and define metrics of interest to enable you to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment. Remember our end goal is to form a strategy based on the findings to provide a clear recommendation to Julia the Category Manager so make sure your insights can have a commercial application.
